# Volodymyr Vasylyna's Website

Hi, you've reached my personal corner of the Internet.

I work as a marketing analyst based in Kyiv, Ukraine. I love exploring different countries & cities, literature, and some quiet rest in the mountains. On my blog, I share thoughts and ideas about personal development, books, work, digital minimalism, and more. See what I'm focusing on [now](now.html) and some of my favorite [bookmarks](bookmarks.html).
