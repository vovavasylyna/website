<h1>Tech skills are not that important</h1>
<p>When I switched from marketing to an analyst job two years ago, I was convinced that the most important thing was to gain hard, technical skills. I felt stressed and anxious because I thought I was lacking them.</p>
<p>Over time I realized that analytics is primarily a business discipline, albeit with technical components. In reality, analytics work should focus on the business side of things, and technical side is given far more importance than it actually deserves.</p>
<p>Instead, communication skills, understanding of business processes and the ability to generate insights using data are far more crucial. They elevate a descriptive analysis to a prescriptive one. The latter creates more additional value for the business, so it increases your career capital faster.</p>
<p>In my current position, I have seen several examples when colleagues having excellent BI and SQL skills could not unlock their potential and grow quickly without understanding the underlying marketing and sales processes. </p>
<p>Sometimes tech skills are overrated. Human connection and business acumen might be a better area to develop.</p>
