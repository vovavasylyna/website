<h1>Productivity and self-development hustle all over Youtube</h1>
<p>Slowly yet steadily my Youtube recommendations have got an enormous amount of youtubers «selling» productivity and self-development content. Each of them started really well and interesting, but as their audiences grew their content strategy transformed into a quite simple clickbait story.</p>
<p>To my opinion, it’s important to not get hooked into all of that. Here’s why.</p>
<p>When I’m watching one of such videos it actually does sound pretty inspiring, trustworthy and valuable. So it’s not surprising why these creators get so popular in a very short period of time. The tricky part here is that their messages are often super trivial and high-level, therefore the videos are easy and fun to watch. In the meantime, the essence of the videos is then getting compensated by neat production with clickbait headlines and thumbnails. As a result, I’m always tempted to click a link fast and feel like I’m not simply wasting my time on Youtube but rather attending a self-development session, as short and non-sense it may be.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, whatever the positioning, it doesn’t necessarily mean that all of such content is pointless. Some parts can actually be life-changing for lots of people. The problem with self-development-oriented stuff on the Internet is that we actually don’t have time to dig through tons of shit looking for tiny useful and valuable things. And that’s quite a bummer. It means though that a proper information diet has to be put in place in order to keep a clear state of mind and have the necessary sharpness of thinking. Otherwise, it is going to be easy to get ourselves drowning in a low-value digital noise.</p>
<p>My personal rule of thumb is now the following: if a content sounds clickbait-y, it’s safer to skip it. The stuff with some real value will find you anyway through personal recommendatios of people you know and whose opinion you value.</p>
