# Why digital minimalism

The purpose of this post is to structure my reason and understanding for why I stick to the Digital Minimalism concept.

**What is Digital Minimalism?**
As [defined](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/12/18/on-digital-minimalism/) by Cal Newport, Digital Minimalism is a philosophy that helps you question what digital communication tools (and behaviors surrounding these tools) add the most value to your life. It is motivated by the belief that intentionally and aggressively clearing away low-value digital noise, and optimizing your use of the tools that really matter, can significantly improve your life.

**What are the benefits?**
I’m building on a muscle to perform focusing for a longer time and high concentration level by minimizing context switching.

Secondly, there’s a more strict information diet put in place. It helps get rid of a bad habit to constantly consume information. Such kind of activity is creating an obstacle to living with a clear state of mind and having the necessary sharpness of thinking.

**How sticking to the Digital Minimalism principles reflect on a daily routine and behavior?**
Speaking of social media, I’m using none of them. Although I still own a Facebook account, I don’t have there anything to scroll through as I no longer follow my Facebook friends, influencers and organizations. This way my feed is empty, and no need to enter Facebook unless I need to manage some work-related stuff. Hence no need to have the Facebook app installed on my phone.

When it comes to other entertaining services, Youtube and Tinder are the only places I still visit quite frequently. Yet not sure how to handle this addiction. Additionally, these ones are the only entertaining apps I have installed on the phone.
