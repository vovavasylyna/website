# Struggle to think positively

It feels like I’m having some unpleasant consequences of a non-positive attitude in life. This thought has been growing over the past several years.

This week I had a follow-up call after my job interview. The words which are now really stuck in my mind are the following:

> I wish you were less concentrated on the things which can’t be done. It would be great if you told me more of the steps which are doable.

I didn’t get the job as you might imagine. I don’t know if this was the actual reason for it, but anyway the lack of positive thinking has been surfaced once again. And I don’t like it at all. So, there is a room for improvement.

This is just a part of the problem, obviously. My attitude and general life philosophy are usually biased towards saying, «Hey, there are lots of problems. It’s super complicated and hard, and bad results are pretty inevitable». Then I’m just wasting a lot of my energy on trying to grasp and digest the negative stuff to its full extent. In the end, of course, there’s no energy for actually getting things done right, the way I want them to be.

I can observe a very similar issue in some of my close friends, too. Most probably, this is the reason why we are such good friends. We’re alike here.

As for now, I don’t have a vision of the concrete way to solve this problem in the long-term. I simply needed to materialize this thinking here, at least in the text format. More to come.
